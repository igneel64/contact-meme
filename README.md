## ContactMeme

A simple yet fun application for the mobile web! Proudly standing on Netlify https://vibrant-mcclintock-cff744.netlify.com/

To use this application you should be 
1) On your mobile phone &#129331;	
2) Using the latest Chrome browser available!
3) `#enable-experimental-web-platform-features` flag in chrome://flags _(until I get a proper token)_

### How it works
Just navigate on the [homepage of the app](https://vibrant-mcclintock-cff744.netlify.com/) and press the button on the top right to add some contacts!

Then you will have some random funny memes generated for each of your contacts selected.

After that you can share the result &#128242; with just pressing the __Share__ button beside it! Have fun!
